## Overview
This package provides a tool for intuitively editing and saving waypoints used in robot navigation while referencing a 2D map.  
The edited waypoints can be saved in **CSV format**.


## Development Environment
- Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish)
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill


## Installation
Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/kzm784/waypoint_editor.git
cd ~/ros2_ws
rosdep update && rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -y
colcon build
```

## Usage
### 1. Launching the Waypoint Editor  
Run the following commands to launch the tool:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch waypoint_editor waypoint_editor.launch.py
```

### 2. Loading a Map (2D / 3D)  
- Use Nav2's `nav2_map_server` to load a 2D map in `.yaml` format.  
- You can also load a 3D map in `.pcd` format.  
- Click the "**Load Map**" button in the bottom-right panel of RViz2 and select the desired `.yaml` file.

### 3. Adding Waypoints  
- From the toolbar at the top of RViz2, select "**Add Waypoint**".  
- Click and drag on the map to add a new waypoint with the desired position and orientation.  
- Once added, each waypoint can:
  - Be **moved or rotated** via drag operations
  - Be **right-clicked** to open a context menu for deletion or other actions

- The waypoints can then be edited again in the same interface.
